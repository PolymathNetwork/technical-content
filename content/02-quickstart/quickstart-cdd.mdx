## Customer Due Diligence (CDD)

Every Polymesh account must pass a **minimal identity verification** before the account is permitted to transact with regulated securities on the network. This minimal verification is called **customer due diligence (CDD)**.

Verifying your identity for CDD purposes means working with a CDD service provider. They will verify the information you send and write an identity claim to the chain for you.

## Assign account

When you first create an account it will show as an unassigned key. This means there is no onchain identity associated with it.

The `Assign` button appears when you hover over an unassigned signing key. The associated link will take you the account context tab in the Polymath [Mainnet Polymesh](https://dashboard.polymath.network/account) or [Testnet Polymesh](https://testnet-dashboard.polymath.network/account) dashboard. From here, you can select `Create Account` to link to the Polymesh onboarding portal.

When connecting to Polymath's dashboard for the first time you will be prompted to authorize it to communicate with your Polymesh Wallet. Press `Authorize` in the wallet popup to allow the page to load.

Click the `Create Account` button to bring you to the appropriate onboarding portal.

**Congratulations! You have completed customer due diligence.**

<HighlightBox type="tip">

Everyone who participates in materially-important transactions on Polymesh must complete customer due diligence (CDD), at a minimum. Asset originators can and usually will augment this minimum requirement with additional KYC requirements but they may not circumvent this minimum requirement.

Since we will use the Testnet for exercises as we discover Polymesh, it is recommended that you complete your CDD now.
