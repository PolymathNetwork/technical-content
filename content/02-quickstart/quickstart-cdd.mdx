Every Polymesh PID must pass a minimal identity verification before the account is permitted to transact with regulated securities on the network. This minimal verification is called Customer Due Diligence.

Verifying your identity for CDD purposes means working with a CDD Service Provider. They will verify the information you send.

## Assign Account

The `Assign` button appears when you hover over an unassigned account and takes you directly to the Account context in the Polymesh Dashboard. Here, you will create a Polymesh ID (PID) and assign your key to the PID.

Your consent is required before the web app can communicate with your Polymesh Wallet. Press `Connect Polymesh Wallet`.

## Complete Customer Due Diligence on Testnet

The web app detects that you are using an unassigned key and informs you that the setup of your new account is incomplete. Press Create a `PolyMesh ID`.

Now, complete the Customer Due Diligence application.

Enter the Verification Code that arrives by email.

It may not be instantaneous, and the Customer Due Diligence process on mainnet will be more stringent than testnet, but very soon you will see an indication that your Polymesh ID has been verified.

Congratulations! You have completed Customer Due Diligence.

<HighlightBox type="tip">

Everyone who participates in materially-important transactions on Polymesh must complete Customer Due Diligence (CDD), at a minimum. Asset Originators can and usually will augment this minimum requirement with additional KYC requirements but they may not circumvent this minimum requirement.

Since we will use the Testnet for exercises as we discover Polymesh, it is recommended that you complete CDD now.
