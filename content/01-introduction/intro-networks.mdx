## Testnet

Alcyone testnet is a fully-functional Polymesh network where you can experiment and test without financial consequence. Use the testnet to practice and experiment. The testnet is an actual instance of the Polymesh protocol, so it uses POLYX for transaction fees and voting, exactly as the mainnet does. However, testnet POLYX and assets you originate and trade are considered valueless.

Notice how the wallet defaults to the Alcyone testnet (at the time of writing) so that one needs to be explicit about transacting with actual assets.

## Local Networks

You can deploy your own local Private network. This is useful if you want to go deeper. For example, a developer may prefer to work alone when developing a custom extension to the protocol itself, an extrinsic. A local, standalone node can perform all of the functions of a complete network.

## Mainnet

Mainnet is where the actual assets are and where the actual transactions take place. You can select the mainnet from the Polymesh Wallet.
