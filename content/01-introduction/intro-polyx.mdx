POLYX is the Polymesh native token used for staking and transaction fees in the economy that secures the network.

## Securing the Network

Arriving at consensus about the ordered list of transactions is a core concern of any blockchain network. The are many processes to choose from. For example, Proof-of-Work and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance. Each such system offers different properties in terms of throughput, transaction finality and fault-tolerance. Proof-of-Work, the consensus process pioneered by Bitcoin offers impressive fault-tolerance in an adversarial setting with anonymous users who may be able to evade accountability. It accomplishes this with financial incentives almost exclusively and it does so at the expense of throughput.

Polymesh relies on a small set of nodes that know exactly who each other are, who are accountable and who are expected to be cooperative. The operators are, generally, major financial institutions that would not be expected to attack the network intentionally.

The system does not rely exclusively on reputation, ethics and recourse to courts of law although these factors are clearly helpful. Malfunctioning, unresponsive or hostile operators are detected by the remaining, well-functioning, well-intentioned operators. There is little rogue operators can do to cause harm to the network beyond a momentary performance hiccup and hey are financially penalised for service interruptions.

Every incentive aligns toward cooperation and reliability.

## Staking

Operators are elected through a governance process where users stake funds (POLYX), i.e. voting with their money. Operators share earnings with those who stake funds with them and this creates a competitive business model in which operators compete for user support on the basis of reliability and expected return on investment. Users share in losses from penalties, as well, which creates an incentive to withdraw support (funds) from unreliable operators. Since only the operators with the most support win the privilege of mining blocks at any given time, another operator will be appointed, by consensus, to take the place of an operator that isn't up to task.

The process is called Nominated Proof-of-Stake and since there is only a handful of operators, coordinating their interactions is very efficient. The resulting chain of blocks is absolulely final with none of the uncertainty that Proof-of-Work systems like Ethereum and Bitcoin are known for. There is no need to await multiple confirmations because all the nodes that _could_ propose a block have already spoken and accepted each block before it is widely distributed.

This process addresses the high-transaction volume concern since there are no abitrary limits on speed or block size. It addresses transaction finality in a way that creates _certainty about transaction finality_ that is essential in the context of regulated securities.

## Voting

Various parameters in the system that one might associate with super-user controls as well as the upgrade process itself are managed through a well-defined, decentralised governance process that includes gathering votes from network users. Users signal support by staking funds (POLYX) on proposals they agree with.

## POLY to POLYX Bridge

So how do you get POLYX?

The Ethereum mainnet has been live since the end of 2015. Since then, it has become the platform of choice for crowdfunding projects via the newly invented term of Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Ethereum, with all its participants, also offers great liquidity from the start of any ICO.

This is one reason why Polymath chose Ethereum to crowdfund the POLY token. Now, to get POLYX on the Polymesh network requires a conversion, from Ethereum POLY to Polymesh POLYX. This conversion is handled by the aptly named POLY to POLYX Bridge. As the name suggests, it is a one-way bridge. At your request, the bridge locks, and later burns, some of your POLY on Ethereum, and mints the same amount, but of POLYX, on the Polymesh network. This burn-then-mint process ensures that the total supply of POLY+POLYX remains unchanged.

Different networks offer tokens at different monetary values, that is why:

* POLY on Ethereum's Kovan testnet -> via the Poly bridge -> convert to POLYX on Polymesh's Alcyone testnet. It is expected that this token remains without any monetary value.
* POLY on Ethereum's mainnet -> via the Poly bridge -> convert to POLYX on Polymesh's mainnet. To find out the token's monetary value, you will have to check on exchanges that carry it.

Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, although anyone can pseudonymously own POLY tokens and profit from their eventual monetary value, it is still necessary, for anyone to use the bridge, to complete the KYC requirements of the target Polymesh platform.
